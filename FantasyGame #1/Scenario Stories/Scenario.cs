You decide to sit down against a tree surrounded with some fallen leafs that looks rather comfortable|
But as the overwhelming feeling of tiredness starts to take over, you slowly close your eyes and doze off|||||||||||||||.|||||||||||||||.|||||||||||||||.

Ahoooooooo|

You're suddenly wide awake by the sound of a howling wolf! Didnt he sound pretty closeby?|";

You walk back to the campfire and break the stick in pieces.|
This'll keep you warm for a while!
If the circumstances were different you could almost enjoy the knispering sounds of the fire,
the warmth it gives, and the night sky above the trees";

You sit down next your campfire and start sharpening the tip of the stick.
Sitting here working on your spear brings you back to the times when you were younger,
goofing around with your big brother.
Reanacting stories father read to you two before bed, that left such a big impression \nthat you couldnt help but stay awake till you couldnt keep your eyes open|
Kinda like you're feeling right now...|||

Wow! Stay awake. This is not the time to fall asleep
You pull yourself together and finish your spear in no time. Right now the circomstances are way more serious.
Dont forget about what situation you are in.
