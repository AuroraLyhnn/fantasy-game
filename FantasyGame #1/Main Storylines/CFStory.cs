Even though you really want to get home as soon as possible,
you realize its better to stay safe than to never make it home at all.|
After all you've heard stories of warriors going through these woods and not making it out alive.|
At least here at the campfire you can see a little of your surroundings, 
get some more rest and who knows, maybe the terrifying creatures of the forest are scared of fire?|
So you throw on some more wood to keep the fire going.|

While waiting for this night to be over you best spend your time on something usefull.
So far you hold the small knife you managed to grab on your way out, 
and some berries you collected from a bush closeby|
What are you going to do?|


1.  Get some rest|
2.  Look around the area|
3.  Eat your your berries|
