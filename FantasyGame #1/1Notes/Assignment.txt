        Requirements

        1. Game Structure

        The game starts with an introduction to the story.

        The player is presented with choices (e.g., "Enter the cave" or "Run away").

        Each choice leads to a different scenario or outcome.



        2. Core Mechanics

        Use a while loop or recursive method to keep the game running until the player "wins" or "loses."

        Use if/else statements to determine outcomes based on player input.



        3. Features
            At least 3 decision points with multiple outcomes.

        At least one "winning" ending and one "losing" ending.



        4. Error Handling

        If the player enters invalid input (e.g., a number instead of "yes" or "no"), display an error message and ask again.

        1. Add a health system, where the player starts with 100 health and loses points based on bad decisions.


        2. Include random events using the Random class.


        3. Allow the player to collect and use items like a sword or a key
