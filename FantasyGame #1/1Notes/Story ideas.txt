slowly during the progression of the game i want to give some more background on the main characters childhood and the reason why theyre in the forest.
But during the game you notice details that are off, like "Hey wasnt my leg bitten off? i guess it was a dream, or did the writer of the program not incorporate it properly?
At the end of the game you find out the one who died when you were younger, and the reason you felt invisible during your growing up, 
and you felt like your dad broke and was only ever spending time on mourning your dead brother was because you were the one that died and not him. 
During the game you get tiny flashes of the moment you were in the exident with your brother, but no details of how it ended."
also the creatures you run into are all like fantasy esk, stuff like 2 heads or globby or really scare, but it confuses the main character. 
They thought they lived in the real world and had never heard of anything like this really exicsting. Stuff like that can also kindoff give away something. 
But mostly makes sense once you play the gave for a second time
